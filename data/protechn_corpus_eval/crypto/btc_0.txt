Top Stories This Week

The Libra storyline is fast becoming a never-ending soap opera ‚Äî and we might be reaching the season finale. Facebook used its latest quarterly report to warn investors that its controversial cryptocurrency may never launch at all. The admission at least shows that the social network is taking the concerns of regulators and policymakers to heart. Although the company still expects Libra to be released in 2020 (for now), it looks like Facebook is laying the groundwork for a U-turn, if need be. Who knows what next week‚Äôs installment will have in store‚Ä¶

When David Marcus, head of Facebook‚Äôs Calibra wallet, appeared in front of Congress last month, he had one warning for U.S. lawmakers: Lead the way on digital currencies, or another nation will. With those words ringing in their ears, some politicians seem to have taken notice. At a hearing of the U.S. Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Sen. Michael Crapo of Idaho broke rank with some of his colleagues. He said he wanted the U.S. to be at the forefront of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, adding the technology ‚Äúboth has incredible potential and incredible risk.‚Äù A fellow senator concurred ‚Äî fearful China might end up getting an upper hand in this fast-moving industry.

The crypto market is often dismissed as a youth-skewed, male-dominated space ‚Äî but a new report reveals perceptions about the scale of the gender imbalance may be misguided. Previous research has indicated that more than 90% of European crypto investors are male, but this latest study suggests 22% of holders are female. What‚Äôs more, they are likelier to be in the top 10% of earners than their male counterparts. Other nuggets of information reveal that Switzerland has the highest rate of crypto ownership in Europe ‚Äî and even though the United Kingdom languishes in 11th place when it comes to its share of European crypto holders, London has the highest concentration of enthusiasts anywhere on the continent.

Is Down Under down with cryptocurrencies? Potentially, based on a new explanatory memorandum issued by Australia‚Äôs government. Although the country plans to ban cash payments for goods and services worth more than 10,000 AUD ($6,900), politicians hope to exclude cryptocurrencies from this rule. Lawmakers say they want to avoid stifling innovation in the burgeoning sector ‚Äî adding that its research suggests ‚Äúthere is little current evidence‚Äù that crypto is being used to facilitate black market activities.

As one country tries to provide clarity on cryptocurrencies, another is making matters murkier. The Financial Conduct Authority, Britain‚Äôs regulator, announced this week that it will not oversee Bitcoin and Ether because they are outside of its remit. To further add to the sense of confusion, the FCA says it can monitor security tokens and utility tokens ‚Äî potentially resulting in a fractured landscape for regulation.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is looking up at around $10,701, Ether at $219 and XRP at $0.32. Total market cap is around $287 billion.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are TRONCLASSIC, Ubricoin and Formosa Financial. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Infinitus Token, EscrowCoin and BQT.

Prediction of the Week

Joe Kernen used to be a Bitcoin bear. Not anymore, it seems. The Squawk Box host stunned his guest by predicting the dominant cryptocurrency could hit $55,000 by May 2020 ‚Äî a price surge of 500% in less than a year‚Äôs time. Indicating that he‚Äôs undergone a full conversion to BTC maximalism, Kernen predicted that the upcoming halving of mining rewards will increase scarcity and result in greater demand.

The new measure applies to individuals, companies and brokerages ‚Äî irrespective of whether the activity involves buying and selling coins, making deposits and withdrawals, or donating to a good cause. In a move that‚Äôs going to result in an immense amount of paperwork for Brazilian hodlers, updates will need to be shared with the taxman every single month ‚Äî with eye-watering punishments if they fail to comply. In addition to penalties of between $25 and $130, up to 3% of the value of nonreported transactions can be charged as a fine.
